@SEDS-UPRM People: Message from Vice President

Hello! If you managed to find this page, it means you either:
a) were given the link by me
b) did you homework correctly!

This is going to be the area to build the website. It'll be moved to a new URL when it is finished. 

The site is built in Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a "sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end 
framework for faster and easier web development." If you don't know what Bootstrap is, don't bother seeing the rest of the
site's code. If you don't know what anything of that quote means, don't bother seeing the rest of the site's code.

If you do know what that stuff was, hurray! You <i>may</i> see the website, but ONLY IF you know the languages Boostrap 
uses to work--HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you don't know any of those, don't bother seeing the rest of the site's code.

If you want to see the site's code and you don't meet the criteria to do so, please contact its main and only coder at:
angelic.arzola@upr.edu

She will give you the necessary information for you to navigate this area without fucking up the site.

Please understand that the reason as to why I am so zealous about this website is because I have worked on it for quite some long time
now, and I can safely assure you that it is <i>quite</i> temperamental. If you don't know what you're doing, you <i>will</i> end up 
breaking it. I know, because back then when I knew virtually nothing of this stuff (3 years ago), I did the same thing--only that, now
I do not have time to fix whatever disasters any John Doe comes along to make. And, the person that has to fix those disasters is <i>me</i>.

I know this all sounds very pretentious and "wow, who does she think she is, Ms. McBossy-I-Know-Everything-Pants?!" but, trust me on this,
y hagame caso.

PS: If you <i>do</i> know and HAVE MADE websites with bootstrap before, then yes, you are welcome aboard this project! I know, I know,
bootstrap isn't that wow or difficult to learn, but it does take some time, which is why I'm warning the rest of these people. Also, do you,
by any chance, know how to make the navbar disappear under the page loader's modal in the areas of the website where the navbar doesn't
blend into the jumbotron? I'm having problems with that. Check the contact page so you can see what I mean.
